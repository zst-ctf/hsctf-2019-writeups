# The Real Reversal
Misc

## Challenge 
My friend gave me some fancy text, but it was reversed, and so I tried to reverse it but I think I messed it up further. Can you find out what the text says?

## Hint
What happens if the file is reversed?

## Solution

The file is of unicode text but the bytes are reversed.

In a python script, reverse it to its original and we see unicode text
